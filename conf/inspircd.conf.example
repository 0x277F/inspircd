#  Syntax is as follows:                                              #
#                                                                     #

#      id="serverid"                                                  #
#      network="MyNetwork">                                           #
#                                                                     #
#  The server name should be a syntactically valid hostname, with at  #
#  least one '.', and does not need to resolve to an IP address.      #
#                                                                     #
#  The description is freeform text. Remember you may put quotes in   #
#  this field by escaping it using \".                                #
#                                                                     #
#  The network field indicates the network name given in on connect   #
#  to clients. It is used by many clients such as mIRC to select a    #
#  perform list, so it should be identical on all servers on a net    #
#  and should not contain spaces.                                     #
#                                                                     #
#  The server ID is optional, and if omitted automatically calculated # 
#  from the server name and description. This is similar in           #
#  in behaviour to the server id on ircu and charybdis ircds.         #
#  You should only need to set this manually if there is a collision  #
#  between two server ID's on the network. The server ID must be      #
#  three digits or letters long, of which the first digit must always #
#  be a number, and the other two letters may be any of 0-9 and A-Z.  #
#  For example, 3F9, 03J and 666 are all valid server IDs, and A9D,   #
#  QFX and 5eR are not. Remember, in most cases you will not need to  #
#  even set this value, it is calculated for you from your server     #
#  name and description. Changing these will change your auto-        #
#  generated ID.                                                      #
#                                                                     #

#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-   PORT CONFIGURATION   -#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-

#   Enter the port and address bindings here.                         #
#                                                                     #
#  bind address - Specifies which address ports bind to. Leaving this #
#                 field blank binds the port to all IP's available.   #
#                                                                     #
#  port         - The port number to bind to. You may specify a port  #
#                 range here, e.g. "6667-6669,7000,7001". If you do   #
#                 this, the server will count each port within your   #
#                 range as a separate binding, making the above       #
#                 example equivalent to five separate bind tags.      #
#                 A failure on one port in the range does not prevent #
#                 the entire range from being bound, just that one    #
#                 port number.                                        #
#                                                                     #
#  type         - Can be 'clients' or 'servers'. The clients type is  #
#                 a standard TCP based socket, the servers type is a  #
#                 also a TCP based connection but of a different      #
#                 format. SSL support is provided by modules, to      #
#                 enable SSL support, please read the module section  #
#                 of this configuration file.                         #
#                                                                     #
#  ssl          - When using m_ssl_gnutls.so or m_ssl_openssl.so      #
#                 modules, you must define this value to use ssl on   #
#                 that port. Valid values are 'gnutls' or 'openssl'   #
#                 respectively. If the module is not loaded, this     #
#                 setting is ignored.                                 #
#                                                                     #
#  transport    - If you have m_spanningtree.so loaded, along with    #
#                 either one of the SSL modules (m_ssl_gnutls or      #
#                 m_ssl_openssl) or m_ziplinks.so, then you may make  #
#                 use of this value.                                  #
#                 Setting it to 'openssl' or 'gnutls' or 'zip'        #
#                 indicates that the port should accept connections   #
#                 using the given transport name. Transports are      #
#                 layers which sit on top of a socket and change the  #
#                 way data is sent and received, e.g. encryption,     #
#                 compression, and other such things. Because this    #
#                 may not be limited in use to just encryption,       #
#                 the 'ssl' value used for client ports does not      #
#                 exist for servers, and this value is used instead.  #

# If InspIRCd is built for IPv6, and you wish to accept IPv4 clients, #
# then you can specify IPv4 ip addresses here to bind. You may also   #
# use the 4in6 notation, ::ffff:1.2.3.4, where 1.2.3.4 is the IPv4    #
# address to bind the port, but as of InspIRCd 1.1.1, this is not     #

# PLEASE NOTE: If you have build InspIRCd as an IPv6 server, and you  #
# specify an empty bind address, the binding will be bound to ALL THE #
# IPv6 IP ADDRESSES, and not the IPv4 addresses. If you are using an  #
# IPv6 enabled InspIRCd and want to bind to multiple IPv4 addresses   #
# in this way, you must specify them by hand. If you have built the   #
# server for IPv4 connections only, then specifying an empty bind     #
# address binds the port to all IPv4 IP addresses, as expected.       #

#   IP masks may be specified in CIDR format or wildcard format,      #
#   for IPv4 and IPv6. You *cannot* use hostnames in the allow or     #

#   You can optionally name your connect allow/deny tags. If you do   #
#   this, you may reference this connect tag as the parent of another #
#   connect tag with the <connect:parent> option as shown above. If   #
#   you do this, any options not explicitly specified in the tag will #
#   be copied from the parent.                                        #
#                                                                     #
#   If the value maxchans is included, this overrides all other max   #
#   channels related settings, including the separate oper maximum.   #
#   You may set this to any (sane) value you wish and it applies to   #
#   all users within this connect tag.                                #
#                                                                     #
#   You may optionally include timeout="x" on any allow line, which   #
#   specifies the amount of time given before an unknown connection   #
#   is closed if USER/NICK/PASS are not given. This value is in secs. #
#                                                                     #
#   You may optionally limit the number of clients that are matched   #
#   by a single <connect> tag by specifying the maximum in the limit  #
#   parameter. If set to 0, there is no limit, which is the default.  #
#                                                                     #
#   You should also include a flood="x" line which indicates          #
#   the number of lines a user may place into their buffer at once    #
#   before they are disconnected for excess flood. This feature can   #
#   not be disabled, however it can be set to extremely high values,  #
#   rendering it effectively disabled. A recommended value is 10.     #
#   A counter is maintained for each user which is reset every        #
#   'threshold' seconds and specifying this threshold value with      #
#   threshold="X" indicates how often the counter is reset. For       #
#   example, with flood="5" and threshold="8", the user may not send  #
#   more than 5 lines in 8 secs.                                      #
#                                                                     #
#   You may optionally specify the sendq size and ping frequency of   #
#   each connect:allow line using the pingfreq="X" and sendq="X"      #
#   settings as shown in the full example below.                      #
#   The ping frequency is specified in seconds, and the sendq size    #
#   in bytes. It is recommended, although not enforced, that you      #
#   should never set your sendq size to less than 8K. Send Queues are #
#   dynamically allocated and can grow as needed up to the maximum    #
#   size specified.                                                   #
#                                                                     #
#   The optional recvq value is the maximum size which users in this  #
#   group may grow their receive queue to. This is recommended to be  #
#   kept pretty low compared to the sendq, as users will always       #
#   receive more than they send in normal circumstances. The default  #
#   if not specified is 4096.                                         #
#                                                                     #
#   The sendq is the data waiting to be sent TO THE USER.             #
#   The recvq is the data being received FROM THE USER.               #
#   The names sendq and recvq are from the SERVER'S PERSPECTIVE not   #
#   that of the user... Just to clear up any confusion or complaints  #
#   that these are backwards :p                                       #
#                                                                     #
#   The localmax and globalmax values can be used to enforce local    #
#   and global session limits on connections. The session limits are  #
#   counted against all users, but applied only to users within the   #
#   class. For example, if you had a class 'A' which has a session    #
#   limit of 3, and a class 'B' which has a session limit of 5, and   #
#   somehow, two users managed to get into class B which also match   #
#   class A, there is only one connection left for this IP now in A,  #
#   but if they can connect again to B, there are three. You get the  #
#   idea (i hope).                                                    #
#                                                                     #
#   NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE!                                    #
#    The maximum limits by default apply to individual IP addresses   #
#    This *MAY* be changed by modifying the <cidr> block, in order    #
#    to detect cloning across an ISP.                                 #
#                                                                     #
#   The optional port value determines which port the connect tag is  #
#   handling. If left out the connect tag covers all bound ports else #
#   only incoming connections on the specified port will match. Port  #
#   tags may be used on connect allow and connect deny tags.          #
#                                                                     #
#   The limit value determines the maximum number of users which may  #
#   be in this class. Combine this with CIDR masks for various ISP    #
#   subnets to limit the number of users which may connect at any one #
#   time from a certain ISP. Omit this value to not limit the tag.    #
#                                                                     #

# CIDR configuration allows detection of clones and applying of       #
# throttle limits across a CIDR range. (A CIDR range is a group of    #
# IPs, for example, the CIDR range 192.168.1.0-192.168.1.255 may be   #
# represented as 192.168.1.0/24). This means that abuse across an ISP #
# is detected and curtailed much easier.                              #
#                                                                     #

#  This specifies how many bits of an IP address should be checked    #
#  against cloning in the <connect> tags, for example, if <connect>   #
#  tags specified a limit of 2 (low!), and three users attempted to   #
#  connect in the IP range 192.168.1.0-192.168.1.255, and ipv4clone   #
#  was set to '24', the third connection would be disconnected.       #
#                                                                     #
#  Valid values are 0-32, but you *don't* want 0. Using values which  #
#  are not multiples of 8 can give confusing behaviour.               #
#  For more info, see: http://www.inspircd.org/wiki/CIDR_Tutorial     #

# ipv6clone works in the same way, except for ipv6 addresses. Valid   #
# range is 0-128, but you *don't* want anything too small.            #
#                                                                     #
# Setting these to their maximum value (32, 128) will result in       #
# no actual CIDR checking being done, and clone checking will only be #
# done across individual IPs. This is the default behaviour.          #

#   Opers are defined here. This is a very important section.         #
#   Remember to only make operators out of trust worthy people.       #
#                                                                     #
#  name        - Oper name, this is case sensitive, so it is best to  #
#                use lower-case.                                      #
#                                                                     #
#  password    - Password to oper-up, also case sensitive.            #
#                encryption is supported via modules. You may load    #
#                modules for MD5 or SHA256 encryption, and if you do, #
#                this value will be a hash value, otherwise put a     #
#                plaintext password in this value.                    #
#                                                                     #
#  host        - Hosts of client allowed to oper-up.                  #
#                wildcards accepted, separate multiple hosts with a   #
#                space. You may also specify CIDR IP addresses.       #
#                                                                     #
#  fingerprint - When using the m_ssl_oper_cert.so module, you may    #
#                specify a key fingerprint here. This can be obtained #
#                using the /fingerprint command whilst the module is  #
#                loaded, or from the notice given to you when you     #
#                connect to the ircd using a client certificate,      #
#                and will lock this oper block to only the user who   #
#                has that specific key/certificate pair.              #
#                this enhances security a great deal, however it      #
#                requires that opers use clients which can send ssl   #
#                client certificates, if this is configured for that  #
#                oper. Note that if the m_ssl_oper.so module is not   #
#                loaded, and/or one of m_ssl_openssl or m_ssl_gnutls  #
#                is not loaded, this configuration option has no      #
#                effect and will be ignored.                          #
#                                                                     #
#  type        - Defines the kind of operator. This must match a type #
#                tag you defined above, and is case sensitive.        #
#                                                                     #

# name        -   The name is the canonical name of the server, does   #
#                 not have to resolve - but it is expected to be set  #
#                 in the remote servers connection info.              #
#                                                                     #
# ipaddr      -   Valid host or IP address for remote server. These   #
#                 hosts are resolved on rehash, and cached, if you    #
#                 specify a hostname; so if you find that your server #
#                 is still trying to connect to an old IP after you   #
#                 have updated your DNS, try rehashing and then       #
#                 attempting the connect again.                       #
#                                                                     #
# port        -   The TCP port for the remote server.                 #
#                                                                     #
# sendpass    -   Password to send to create an outbound connection   #
#                 to this server.                                     #
#                                                                     #
# recvpass    -   Password to receive to accept an inbound connection #
#                 from this server.                                   #
#                                                                     #
# autoconnect -   Sets the server to autoconnect. Where x is the num. #
# (optional)      of seconds between attempts. e.g. 300 = 5 minutes.  #
#                                                                     #
# transport     - If defined, this is a transport name implemented by #
#                 another module. Transports are layers on top of     #
#                 plaintext connections, which alter them in certain  #
#                 ways. Currently the three supported transports are  #
#                 'openssl' and 'gnutls' which are types of SSL       #
#                 encryption, and 'zip' which is for compression.     #
#                 If you define a transport, both ends of the         #
#                 connection must use a compatible transport for the  #
#                 link to succeed. OpenSSL and GnuTLS are link-       #
#                 compatible with each other.                         #
#                                                                     #
# statshidden   - When using m_spanningtree.so for linking. you may   #
#                 set this to 'yes', and if you do, the IP address/   #
#                 hostname of this connection will NEVER be shown to  #
#                 any opers on the network. In /stats c its address   #
#                 will show as *@<hidden>, and during CONNECT and     #
#                 inbound connections, it's IP will show as <hidden>  #
#                 UNLESS the connection fails (e.g. due to a bad      #
#                 password or servername)                             #
#                                                                     #
# allowmask     - When this is defined, it indicates a range of IP    #
#                 addresses to allow for this link (You may use CIDR  #
#                 or wildcard form for this address).                 #
#                 e.g. if your server is going to connect to you from #
#                 the range 1.2.3.1 through 1.2.3.255, put 1.2.3.0/24 #
#                 into this value. If it is not defined, then only    #
#                 the ipaddr field of the server shall be allowed.    #
#                                                                     #
# failover      - If you define this option, it must be the name of a #
#                 different link tag in your configuration. This      #
#                 option causes the ircd to attempt a connection to   #
#                 the failover link in the event that the connection  #
#                 to this server fails. For example, you could define #
#                 two hub uplinks to a leaf server, and set an        #
#                 american server to autoconnect, with a european     #
#                 hub as its failover. In this situation, your ircd   #
#                 will only try the link to the european hub if the   #
#                 american hub is unreachable. NOTE that for the      #
#                 intents and purposes of this option, an unreachable #
#                 server is one which DOES NOT ANSWER THE CONNECTION. #
#                 If the server answers the connection with accept(), #
#                 EVEN IF THE CREDENTIALS ARE INVALID, the failover   #
#                 link will not be tried! Failover settings will also #
#                 apply to autoconnected servers as well as manually  #
#                 connected ones.                                     #
#                                                                     #
# timeout       - If this is defined, then outbound connections will  #
#                 time out if they are not connected within this many #
#                 seconds. If this is not defined, the default of ten #
#                 seconds is used.                                    #
#                                                                     #
# bind          - If you specify this value, then when creating an    #
#                 outbound connection to the given server, the IP you #
#                 place here will be bound to. This is for multi-     #
#                 homed servers which may have multiple IP addresses. #
#                 if you do not define this value, the first IP that  #
#                 is not empty or localhost from your <bind> tags     #
#                 will be bound to. This is usually acceptable,       #
#                 however if your server has multiple network cards   #
#                 then you may have to manually specify the bind      #
#                 value instead of leaving it to automatic binding.   #
#                 you can usually tell if you need to set this by     #
#                 looking for the error 'Could not assign requested   #
#                 address' in your log when connecting to servers.    #
#                                                                     #
# hidden        - If this is set to true, yes, or 1, then the server  #
#                 is completely hidden from non-opers. It does not    #
#                 show in /links and it does not show in /map. Also,  #
#                 any servers which are child servers of this one     #
#                 in the network will *also* be hidden. Use with      #
#                 care! You can use this to 'mask off' sections of    #
#                 the network so that users only see a small portion  #
#                 of a much larger net. It should NOT be relied upon  #
#                 as a security tool, unless it is being used for     #
#                 example to hide a non-client hub, for which clients #
#                 do not have an IP address or resolvable hostname.   #
#                                                                     #
# To u:line a server (give it extra privileges required for running   #
# services, Q, etc) you must include the <uline server> tag as shown  #
# in the example below. You can have as many of these as you like.    #
#                                                                     #
# WARNING: Unlike other ircds, u:lining a server allows ALL users on  #
# that server to operoverride modes. This should only be used for     #
# services and protected oper servers!                                #
#                                                                     #

# NOTE: If you have built your server as an IPv6 server, then when a  #
# DNS lookup of a server's host occurs, AAAA records (IPv6) are       #
# prioritised over A records (IPv4). Therefore, if the server you are #
# connecting to has both an IPv6 IP address and an IPv4 IP address in #
# its DNS entry, the IPv6 address will *always* be selected. To       #
# change this behaviour simply specify the IPv4 IP address rather     #
# than the hostname of the server.                                    #

#  If you want to link servers to InspIRCd you must load the          #
#  m_spanningtree.so module! Please see the modules list below for    #
#  information on how to load this module! If you do not load this    #
#  module, server links will NOT work!                                #

#  Also, if you define any transports, you must load the modules for  #
#  these transports BEFORE you load m_spanningtree, e.g. place them   #
#  above it in the configuration file. Currently this means the three #
#  modules m_ssl_gnutls, m_ziplinks and m_ssl_openssl, depending on   #
#  which you choose to use.                                           #

# Define your DNS server address here. InspIRCd has its own resolver. #
# If you do not define this value, then InspIRCd will attempt to      #
# determine your DNS server from your operating system. On POSIX      #
# platforms, InspIRCd will read /etc/resolv.conf, and populate this   #
# value with the first DNS server address found. On Windows platforms #
# InspIRCd will check the registry, and use the DNS server of the     #
# first active network interface, if one exists.                      #
# If a DNS server cannot be determined from these checks, the default #
# value '127.0.0.1' is used instead. The timeout value is in seconds. #

# When choosing a server, be sure to choose one which will do a       #
# RECURSIVE LOOKUP. InspIRCd's resolver does not currently do these   #
# recursive lookups itself, to save time and resources. The DNS       #
# server recommended by the InspIRCd team is bind, available from the #
# ISC website. If your DNS server does not do a recursive lookup, you #
# will be able to notice this by the fact that none of your users are #
# resolving even though the DNS server appears to be up! Most ISP and #
# hosting provider DNS servers support recursive lookups.             #
#                                                                     #

# NOTE: If you have built InspIRCd with IPv6 support, then both       #
# IPv6 and IPv4 addresses are allowed here, and also in the system    #

#  noservices    - If noservices is true, yes, or 1, then the first   #
#                  user into a channel gets founder status. This is   #
#                  only useful on networks running the m_chanprotect  #

#                  a visible prefix to users set +q (founder) in chan #
#                  It should be set to something sensible like ~ or ! #

#                  user with +q or +a may remove the +q or +a from    #
#                  themselves. The default setting is to not enable   #

#                  away their founder status without using services.  #

#                  this feature, so that only +q may remove +a, and   #
#                  nothing but services may remove +q.                #

#                  frequency of server to server PING messages. This  #
#                  can help if you are having certain network issues. #
#                                                                     #
#  pingwarning   - This should be set to a number between 1 and 59 if #

#                  to send out a warning via snomask +l if a server   #
#                  does not answer to PING after this many seconds.   #
#                  This can be useful for finding servers which are   #
#                  at risk of pinging out due to network issues.      #
#                                                                     #
#  defaultmodes  - The default modes to be given to each channel on   #

#                  or - symbols in this sequence, if you add them     #
#                  they will be ignored. You may add parameters for   #

#  maxwho        - The maximum number of results returned by a /WHO   #
#                  query. This is to prevent /WHO being used as a     #
#                  spam vector or means of flooding an ircd. The      #
#                  default is 128, it is not recommended to raise it  #
#                  above 1024. Values up to 65535 are permitted. If   #
#                  this value is omitted, any size WHO is allowed by  #
#                  anyone.                                            #
#                                                                     #
#  somaxconn     - The maximum number of sockets that may be waiting  #
#                  in the accept queue. This usually allows the ircd  #
#                  to soak up more connections in a shorter space of  #
#                  time when increased but please be aware there is a #
#                  system defined maximum value to this, the same way #
#                  there is a system defined maximum number of file   #
#                  descriptors. Some systems may only allow this to   #
#                  be up to 5 (ugh) while others such as FreeBSD will #
#                  default to a much nicer 128.                       #
#                                                                     #
#  softlimit     - This optional feature allows a defined softlimit.  #
#                  if defined sets a soft maxconnections value, has   #
#                  to be less than the ./configure maxclients         #
#                                                                     #
#  nouserdns     - If set to yes, true or 1, no user DNS lookups      #
#                  will be performed for connecting users. This can   #
#                  save a lot of resources on very busy IRC servers.  #
#                                                                     #
#  quietbursts   - When synching or splitting from the network, a     #
#                  server can generate a lot of connect and quit      #
#                  snotices to the +C and +Q snomasks. Setting this   #
#                  value to yes squelches those messages, which can   #
#                  make them more useful for opers, however it will   #
#                  degrade their use by certain third party programs  #
#                  such as BOPM which rely on them to scan users when #
#                  a split heals in certain configurations.           #

#                - If this option is set, then invites are announced  #
#                  to the channel when a user invites another user.   #
#                  If you consider this to be unnecessary noise,      #
#                  set this to 'none'. To announce to all ops, set    #
#                  this to 'ops' and to announce to all users set the #
#                  value to 'all'.                                    #
#                                                                     #
#                  The value 'dynamic' varies between 'ops' and 'all' #
#                  settings depending on if the channel is +i or not. #
#                  When the channel is +i, messages go only to ops,   #
#                  and when the channel is not +i, messages go to     #
#                  everyone. In short, the messages will go to every  #
#                  user who has power of INVITE on the channel. This  #
#                  is the recommended setting.                        #
#                                                                     #
#  disablehmac   - If you are linking your InspIRCd to older versions #
#                  then you can specify this option and set it to     #
#                  yes. 1.1.6 and above support HMAC and challenge-   #
#                  response for password authentication. These can    #
#                  greatly enhance security of your server to server  #
#                  connections when you are not using SSL (as is the  #
#                  case with a lot of larger networks). Linking to    #
#                  older versions of InspIRCd should not *usually* be #
#                  a problem, but if you have problems with HMAC      #
#                  authentication, this option can be used to turn it #
#                  off.                                               #
#                                                                     #
#  hidemodes     - If this option is enabled, then the listmodes      #
#                  given (e.g. +eI), will be hidden from users below  #
#                  halfop. This is not recommended to be set on mode  #
#                  +b, as it may break some features in popular       #
#                  clients such as mIRC.                              #

#  hidesplits    - When set to 'yes', will hide split server names    #
#                  from non-opers. Non-opers will see '*.net *.split' #
#                  instead of the server names in the quit message,   #
#                  identical to the way IRCu displays them.           #
#                                                                     #
#  hidebans      - When set to 'yes', will hide gline, kline, zline   #
#                  and qline quit messages from non-opers. For        #
#                  example, user A who is not an oper will just see   #
#                  (G-Lined) while user B who is an oper will see the #
#                  text (G-Lined: Reason here) instead.               #
#                                                                     #
#  hidewhois     - When defined with a non-empty value, the given     #
#                  text will be used in place of the user's server    #
#                  in WHOIS, when a user is WHOISed by a non-oper.    #
#                  For example, most nets will want to set this to    #
#                  something like '*.netname.net' to conceal the      #
#                  actual server the user is on.                      #
#                                                                     #
#  flatlinks     - When you are using m_spanningtree.so, and this     #
#                  value is set to yes, true or 1, /MAP and /LINKS    #
#                  will be flattened when shown to a non-opers.       #
#                                                                     #
#  hideulines    - When you are using m_spanningtree.so, and this     #
#                  value is set to yes, true or 1, then U-lined       #
#                  servers will be hidden in /LINKS and /MAP for non  #
#                  opers. Please be aware that this will also hide    #
#                  any leaf servers of a U-lined server, e.g. jupes.  #
#                                                                     #
#  userstats     - The userstats field is optional and specifies      #
#                  which stats characters in /STATS may be requested  #
#                  by non-operators. Stats characters in this field   #
#                  are case sensitive and are allowed to users        #
#                  independent of if they are in a module or the core #
#                                                                     #
#  operspywhois  - If this is set then when an IRC operator uses      #
#                  /WHOIS on a user they will see all channels, even  #
#                  ones if channels are secret (+s), private (+p) or  #
#                  if the target user is invisible +i.                #
#                                                                     #
#  customversion - If you specify this configuration item, and it is  #
#                  not set to an empty value, then when a user does   #
#                  a /VERSION command on the ircd, this string will   #
#                  be displayed as the second portion of the output,  #
#                  replacing the system 'uname', compile flags and    #
#                  socket engine/dns engine names. You may use this   #
#                  to enhance security, or simply for vanity.         #
#                                                                     #
#  maxtargets    - The maxtargets field is optional, and if not       #
#                  defined, defaults to 20. It indicates the maximum  #
#                  number of targets which may be given to commands   #
#                  such as PRIVMSG, KICK etc.                         #
#                                                                     #
#  hidekills     - The hidekills value, if set, replaces the source   #
#                  of all oper-generated kills to be the given text   #
#                  to provide anonimity to your opers.                #
#                                                                     #

# This configuration tag defines the maximum sizes of various types   #
# on IRC, such as the maximum length of a channel name, and the       #
# maximum length of a channel. Note that with the exception of the    #
# identmax value all values given here are the exact values you would #
# expect to see on IRC. This contrasts with the older InspIRCd        #
# releases where these values would be one character shorter than     #
# defined to account for a null terminator on the end of the text.    #
#                                                                     #
# The identmax value has special meaning, as it may grow one          #
# character longer than you specify, to accomodate for a ~ character  #

# These values should match network-wide, otherwise you may end up    #
# with desyncs, and confusing your users by being able to use a nick  #
# of a certain length on one server but not on another. Servers will  #
# link with mismatched values, but this is NOT recommended as a long  #

# Logging
# -------
#
# Logging is covered with the <log> tag, which you may use to change
# the behaviour of the logging of the IRCd.
#
# In InspIRCd as of 1.2, logging is pluggable and very extensible.
# Different files can log the same thing, different 'types' of log can
# go to different places, and modules can even extend the log tag
# to do what they want.
#
# An example log tag would be:
#	<log method="file" type="OPER" level="default" target="opers.log">
# which  would log all information on /oper (failed and successful) to
# a file called opers.log.
#
# There are many different types which may be used, and modules may
# generate their own. A list of useful types:

# Channel Logging
# ---------------
#
# I'm aware this would probably better belong in the modules section, but this
# is heavily interrelated to logging, and as such will be documented here.
#
# m_chanlog is one of the modules which can alter logging to it's own thing.
# An example of this may be:
#
#<module name="m_chanlog.so">
#<log method="channel" type="OPER USERS CHANNELS" level="default" target="#services">
#
# The following log tag is highly default and uncustomised. It is recommended you
# sort out your own log tags. This is just here so you get some output.
<log method="file" type="* -USERINPUT -USEROUTPUT -m_spanningtree" level="default" target="ircd.log">

# This optional tag allows you to specify how wide a gline, eline,    #
# kline, zline or qline can be before it is forbidden from being      #
# set. By setting hostmasks="yes", you can allow all G, K, E lines,   #
# no matter how many users the ban would cover. This is not           #
# recommended! By setting ipmasks="yes", you can allow all Z lines,   #
# no matter how many users these cover too. Needless to say we        #
# don't recommend you do this, or, set nickmasks="yes", which will    #

# The trigger value indicates how wide any mask will be before it is  #
# prevented from being set. The default value is 95.5% if this tag is #
# not defined in your configuration file, meaning that if your        #
