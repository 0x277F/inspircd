#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-  SERVER DESCRIPTION  -#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-
#								      #
#   Here is where you enter the information about your server.        #
#								      #
#  Syntax is as follows:					      #
#     <server name="server.name"				      #
#      description="Server Description"				      #
#      network="MyNetwork">					      #
#								      #

<server name="penguin.omega.org.za"

#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-   ADMIN INFORMATION   -#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#
#								      #
#   Describes the Server Administrator's real name, nick	      #
#   and email address.                   			      #
#								      #
#  Syntax is as follows:					      #

#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-   PORT CONFIGURATION   -#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-
#								      #
#   Enter the port and address bindings here.	                      #
#								      #
#  bind address - specifies which the address which ports bind	      #	
#  port		- opens an unused port				      #
#  type         - can be 'clients' or 'servers'. The clients type is  #
#                 a standard tcp based socket, the servers type is a  #
#                 UDP based connection.                               #
#  default      - if the port type is 'servers' then this can be      #
#                 specified. If set to 'yes', it indicates that this  #
#                 port is the default route for all /connect commands.#
#                 if you do not bind your default route to an         #
#                 external ip, or all ip's, you may have connection   #
#                 problems.                                           #
#								      #
#  Leaving address empty binds to all available interfaces            #

#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-  CONNECTIONS CONFIGURATION   -#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-
#								      #
#   This is where you can configure which connections are allowed     #
#   and denied access onto your server.				      #
#   The password is optional.					      #
#   You may have as many of these as you require.                     #
#   To allow/deny all connections use a *                             #

#   You may optionally include timeout="x" on any allow line, which   #
#   specifies the amount of time given before an unknown connection   #
#   is closed if USER/NICK/PASS are not given. This value is in secs  #
#								      #
#   You may also optionally include a flood="x" line which indicates  #
#   the number of lines a user may place into their buffer at once    #
#   before they are disconnected for excess flood. The default is to  #
#   DISABLE this feature. A recommended value is 10.                  #

#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-  CLASS CONFIGURATION   -#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-
#								      #
#   Classes are a group of commands which are grouped together        #

#   are available to certain types of Operators.                      #
#								      #
#  Syntax is as follow:						      #

#								      #
#   This is where you specify which types of operators you have on    #
#   your server, as well as the commands they are allowed to use.     #
#   This works alongside with the classes specified above.	      #
#								      #
#  type name  - a name for the combined class types		      #
#  classes    - specified above, used for flexibility for the         #
#               server admin to decide on which operators get         #
#		what commands					      #
#  host	      - hostmask operators will recieve on oper-up            #

#              encryption not yet available			      #
#  host      - host of client allowed to oper-up, more hostmasks      #
#              seperated by spaces, wildcards accepted	              #
#  type      - specified above, defines the kind of operator	      #
#								      #
