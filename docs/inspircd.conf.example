#								      #
#   Here is where you enter the information about your server.        #
#								      #
#  Syntax is as follows:					      #
#     <server name="server.name"				      #

#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-   ADMIN INFORMATION   -#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#
#								      #
#   Describes the Server Administrator's real name, nick	      #
#   and email address.                   			      #
#								      #

#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-   PORT CONFIGURATION   -#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-
#								      #
#   Enter the port and address bindings here.	                      #
#								      #
#  bind address - specifies which the address which ports bind	      #	
#  port		- opens an unused port				      #
#  type         - can be 'clients' or 'servers'. The clients type is  #
#                 a standard tcp based socket, the servers type is a  #
#                 also a TCP based connection but of a different      #
#                 format.                                             #
#  default      - if the port type is 'servers' then this can be      #
#                 specified. If set to 'yes', it indicates that this  #
#                 port is the default route for all /connect commands.#
#                 if you do not bind your default route to an         #
#                 external ip, or all ip's, you may have connection   #
#                 problems.                                           #

#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-  CONNECTIONS CONFIGURATION   -#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-
#								      #
#   This is where you can configure which connections are allowed     #
#   and denied access onto your server.				      #
#   The password is optional.					      #
#   You may have as many of these as you require.                     #
#   To allow/deny all connections use a *                             #
#								      #
#  Syntax is as follows:					      #
#	<connect allow="ip or host">				      #
#	<connect allow="ip or host" password="blahblah">              #
#       <connect allow="ip or host" password="blah" timeout="10">     #
#	<connect allow="ip or host" timeout="blah" flood="5">         #
#       <connect allow="ip or host" threshold="8" pingfreq="120">     #
#       <connect allow="ip or host" sendq="99999">                    #
#	<connect deny="ip or host">				      #
#                                                                     #
#   You may optionally include timeout="x" on any allow line, which   #
#   specifies the amount of time given before an unknown connection   #
#   is closed if USER/NICK/PASS are not given. This value is in secs  #
#								      #
#   You may also optionally include a flood="x" line which indicates  #
#   the number of lines a user may place into their buffer at once    #
#   before they are disconnected for excess flood. The default is to  #
#   DISABLE this feature. A recommended value is 10. A counter is     #
#   maintained for each user which is reset every 'threshold' seconds #
#   and specifying this threshold value with threshold="X" indicates  #
#   how often the counter is reset. For example, with flood="5" and   #
#   threshold="8", the user may not send more than 5 lines in 8 secs. #
#                                                                     #
#   You may optionally specify the sendq size and ping frequency of   #
#   each connect:allow line using the pingfreq="X" and sendq="X"      #
#   settings as shown in the full example below.                      #
#   The ping frequency is specified in seconds, and the sendq size    #
#   in bytes. It is recommended, although not enforced, that you      #
#   should never set your sendq size to less than 8k. Send Queues are #
#   dynamically allocated and can grow as needed up to the maximum    #
#   size specified.                                                   #
#                                                                     #

#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-  CLASS CONFIGURATION   -#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-
#								      #
#   Classes are a group of commands which are grouped together        #
#   and given a unique name. They used to define which commands       #
#   are available to certain types of Operators.                      #
#								      #
#  Syntax is as follow:						      #

#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-  OPERATOR COMPOSITION   -#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#
#								      #
#   This is where you specify which types of operators you have on    #
#   your server, as well as the commands they are allowed to use.     #
#   This works alongside with the classes specified above.	      #
#								      #
#  type name  - a name for the combined class types		      #

#              encryption not yet available			      #
#  host      - host of client allowed to oper-up, more hostmasks      #
#              seperated by spaces, wildcards accepted	              #

# Defines which servers can link to this one, and which servers this  #
# server may create outbound links to.                                #

# name      - The name is the canocial name of the server, it does    #
#             not have to resolve - but it is expected to be sent in  #
#             the remote servers connection info.                     #
# ipaddr    - Valid host or ip address for remote server. *           #
# port      - Valid listening UDP port for remote server.             #
# sendpass  - Password to send to create an outbound connection to    #
#             this server.                                            #
# recvpass  - Password to receive to accept an inbound connection     #

# to u:line a server (give it extra privilages required for running   #
# services, Q, etc) you must include the <uline server> tag as shown  #
# in the example below. You can have as many of these as you like.    #
#                                                                     #
# WARNING: Unlike other ircds, u:lining a server allows ALL users on  #
# that server to operoverride modes. This should only be used for     #
# services and protected oper servers!                                #
#                                                                     #
# IMPORTANT NOTE: When specifying the ip address and/or host, the     #
# server software will prioritize RESOLVED hostnames above ip         #
# addresses, so for example if your target server resolves to a.b.com #
# you MUST put a.b.com into your link block, and NOT the IP address   #
# of a.b.com. The system uses reverse resolution.                     #
#                                                                     #

#								      #
#   Settings to define which features are useable on your server.     #
#								      #
#  prefixquit    - a prefix for a client's quit message               #
#  loglevel      - specifies what detail of messages to log in the    #
#                  log file. You may select from debug, verbose,      #
#                  default, sparse and none.                          #
#  allowhalfop   - allows the +h channel mode			      #
#  noservices    - If noservices is true, yes, or 1, then the first   #
#                  user into a channel gets founder status. This is   #
#                  only useful on networks running the m_chanprotect  #

#  These tags define which modules will be loaded on startup by your  #
#  server. Add modules without any paths. When you make your ircd     #
#  using the 'make' command, all compiled modules will be moved into  #
#  the folder you specified when you ran ./configure. The module tag  #
#  automatically looks for modules in this location.                  #

# If you have the m_alias.so module loaded, you may also define       #
# aliases as shown below. They are commonly used to provide shortcut  #
# commands to services, however they are not limited to jsut this use.#
# An alias tag requires the following values to be defined in it:     #
#                                                                     #
# text        -      The text to detect at the start of the line,     #
#                    must be at the start of the line to trigger the  #
#                    alias. May contain spaces, but case insensitive. #
# replace     -      The text to replace 'text' with. Usually this    #
#                    will be "PRIVMSG ServiceName :" or similar.      #
# requires    -      If you provide a value for 'requires' this means #
#                    the given nickname MUST be online for the alias  #
#                    to successfully trigger. If they are not, then   #
#                    the user receives a 'no such nick' 401 numeric.  #
# uline       -      Defining this value with 'yes', 'true' or '1'    #
#                    will ensure that the user given in 'requires'    #
#                    must also be on a u-lined server, as well as     #
#                    actually being on the network. If the user is    #
#                    online, but not on a u-lined server, then an     #
#                    oper-alert is sent out as this is possibly signs #
#                    of a user trying to impersonate a service.       #
#                                                                     #
